FreeBSD crunchgen simple example
--------------------------------

Crunchgen adds the name of the program to whatever directory you specify
in the configuration file. We just need to make sure that the tarball 
"src.txz" which corresponds to our release is unarchived and ready.
For brevities sake I have chosen to only include `sh', `dmesg' and `cp'.
Which only requires the paths "/usr/src/sbin", "/usr/src/bin" and "/lib".

  ftp ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/i386/i386/9.2-STABLE/src.txz
  tar -xf src.txz -C /

  cat > crunched.conf << EOF
  srcdirs /usr/src/sbin  /usr/src/bin /lib
  progs sh dmesg cp
  libs -lutil -lcrypt -ll -ledit -ltermcap
  libs -lipsec -lm
  libs -lkvm
  EOF

  crunchgen crunched.conf
  make -f crunched.mk

If all went as planned and there were no significant compile errors
you will be left with a statically linked binary called "crunched".
You can run it and test it:

  ./crunched
